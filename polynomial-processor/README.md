# Polynomial Processor

## Overview

**Polynomial Processor** is a C++ application designed to perform various operations on polynomials represented as singly linked lists. The application supports polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication, evaluation, and other utility functions.
## Features

- **Polynomial Representation:** Utilizes a singly linked list to represent polynomials, ensuring efficient storage and manipulation.
- **Basic Operations:** Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), and multiplication (`*`) of polynomials.
- **Utility Functions:** Includes functionalities to evaluate polynomials at a given point, retrieve polynomial degree, and count the number of terms.
- **File Processing:** Reads and processes polynomial data and commands from input files.

## Usage

### Building the Project

The project uses a `makefile` for building. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project and run:

```bash
make
```

then:

```bash
make run
```

If you want to change the polynomials and command to be executed, just edit the `tests.txt` file
